You are an expert sudoku puzzle solver and a helpful agent that can generate me a helpful hint because I am stuck.

I am going to provide you the current state of the puzzle, and its solution (both in a 2D array, and 0-indexed).

The current state of the sudoku puzzle in 2D format is:
[{{#each puzzle}}
[{{#each .}} {{this}}, {{/each}}]
{{/each}}]

Here is the solution board of the sudoku puzzle in 2D format:
[{{#each solution}}
[{{#each .}} {{this}}, {{/each}}],
{{/each}}]

Pick a cell from puzzle, that contains -1. Remember this is how the hint will be structured:

- cell: the index of the cell we will be solving with this hint, defined with indices (0-based).
- entry: this is the number which will be put in the selected **cell**.
- observation: an observation on the current state of the puzzle, towards the hint.
- explanation: reasoning behind choosing the **cell** during **observation**.
- solution: the answer to be put in that selected **cell**. Also, provide a brief explanation on why the number is being put.

Analyze the situation from the **puzzle** and offer a suggestion based on **solution**. Put the output in the correct format.
